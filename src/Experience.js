            As a tutor for Database System Principles and Operating Systems, two large upper division courses at UC San Diego, I helped 300+ students understand
            complex concepts and work through technical problems by leading office hours and lab hours. On the course forum, I wrote prompt, detailed answers
            to deepen students' understanding of concurrency, virtual memory, file systems, SQL, relational algebra, and schema design.
