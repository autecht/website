        <BodyBox>
          I'm a recent Computer Science graduate from UC San Diego with strong academic foundations (4.0 GPA) and hands-on experience in software development.
          I've applied my skills in agile development, object-oriented programming, relational databases, and version control.
          By tutoring in relational databases and operating systems, I not only helped others succeed, but also strengthened my grasp of complex material.
          I'm excited to bring my passion for building reliable, impactful software in a collaborative setting to a full-time engineering role.

        <BodyBox>
          Outside of academics, I enjoy exploring new worlds and lives through reading, video games, and shows.
          In the world I live in, I love to exercise, play chess, and spend time with friends and family.
          I don't go on hikes often enough, but I love walking through nature when I can.
          In everyday life, I care about compassion and ethics â€” one way this shows up is being vegan.
